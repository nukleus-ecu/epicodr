Import, primary coding and export functions for data of the National Pandemic Cohort Network [NAPKON](https://www.napkon.de). 

## :floppy_disk: Versions & Download

[Releases](https://github.com/nukleus-ecu/epicodr/releases)

## :hammer: How to use this package

Using this package, you can import SÜP, HAP and POP data exported from SecuTrial by the Transfer-Office, set variable and value labels, format date variables, perform primary coding, as well as export the data, e.g. in SPSS format.

### Tutorial
You can find a tutorial on how to use this package on YouTube at [NUKLEUS ECU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAY-DGsRYqU).

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Install a R runtime environment and git on your computer. Provide Internet access.
2. Create a R file and put the following code inside:
```r
# Install package remotes
if(!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")

# Install package epicodr
# replace "release" with a specific version, if necessary
# See section *Versions* for more details
remotes::install_github("nukleus-ecu/epicodr@*release")

# Load package epicodr
library(epicodr)

# Specifiy location where to find data zip file
zip_file_path <- "data/import/NAME_OF_EXPORT_FILE.zip"

# Import the zip file data
data <- zip_file_path %>% 
  read_tsExport(separator = ";", decimal = ",")

# Execute primary coding on data
data_primary_coded <- data %>% 
  # place coding function accordingly, e.g., primary_coding_suep() or primary_coding_hap() or primary_coding_pop()
  primary_coding_suep()
  
# Execute Post-COVID-Syndrom Score (PCS score) for SUEP and HAP data
# if you only want to use the primary-coding function for the PCS score, use line 49
# if you already primary-coded your data using lines 40-42, use line 51
# please specify if you want the PCS score with (prom = "Yes") or without (prom = "No") patient reported outcome measures (PROMs)
# for detailed information abou PCS score with and without PROMs see primary-coding manual for SUEP or HAP (link below)
 # place coding function accordingly, e.g., primary_coding_suep_pcs_score() or primary_coding_hap_pcs_score()
data_primary_coded_pcs <- primary_coding_suep_pcs_score(data, prom = "No")

data_primary_coded_pcs <- primary_coding_suep_pcs_score(data_primary_coded, prom = "No")
  
# Prepare data for SPSS export (remove .factor variables, add value labels, 
# optionally remove original date variables and set default missing values)
# - Set rm_stdates = FALSE if you want to keep original secutrial date variables
# - set_missings = TRUE, assign general missing values for the whole data set. 
#   Type "missing_labels_default" into console (without quotes) in order to 
#    check default values that are set to missing.
# - Additional Options: 
#   - keep_date_vars: character vector of date variable names that should be 
#     kept when rm_stdates = TRUE. Default: "birthdate_score"
#   - missing_labels: character vector that defines variable labels that should 
#     be set as missing value. Default: missing_labels_default
#   - missing_values: numeric vector that defines variable values that should be 
#     set as missing value. Default: NULL
data_spss_export_prepared <- prepare_spss_export(data_primary_coded, 
                                                 rm_stdates = TRUE, 
												 set_missings = TRUE)

# Export the prepared data in R to formats of other statistical software e.g. SPSS (sav) to export folder
# For other formats replace 'data_spss_export_prepared' with 'data_primary_coded' and "sav" with (one of "dta", "sas", "sav", "xpt")
write_tsExport(data_spss_export_prepared, format = "sav", path = "data/export/", metadata = TRUE)

```
3. Run the script.
4. Data is exported to folder [data/export](data/export).


### Alternative: Clone this Repository

1. Install a R runtime environment and git on your computer. Provide Internet access.
2. Clone this repository: ```git clone https://github.com/nukleus-ecu/epicodr.git```
3. Export data from secuTrial and place the *.zip file in [data/import/](data/import).
4. Create a new R script and add previously shown code for sample import, primary coding and SPSS export or create a new R script by yourself.
5. Data is exported to folder [data/export](data/export).


## :pencil2: Supported data structure

Descriptions of the primary codings of the NAPKON cohort platforms SÜP, POP and HAP are available at the following link:

Additionally, there are manuals that include variable categorizations, aids for calculating scores, defining normal ranges of laboratory parameters and clinical parameters. Further explanations are also available in the tutorial presentation.
